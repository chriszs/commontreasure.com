<h2><a href="../">2010</a> &raquo; Installation Instructions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Open <a href="../license.txt">license.txt</a> and familiarize yourself with the terms under which you are permitted
	to use the software (GPLv3). Please pay particular attention to the part which attempts
	to shield me from liability if you screw up while using these steps.</li>
	
<li>Download the budget CSV files from the Office of Management and Budget website
	or Data.gov. Currently available here: <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/Supplemental/">http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/Supplemental/</a></li>
	
<li>Open <a href="install.sql">docs/install.sql</a> and change &lt;REPLACE WITH PATH TO FILE&gt; to the path to budgetauth.csv,
	outlays.csv, and receipts.csv.
	<br />
	<br />
	If you are on a shared server you might either need to do steps 3-4 on a local machine first
	and then export and import the resulting SQL, or use a different method to import the CSV file.</li>
	
<li>Run <a href="install.sql">docs/install.sql</a> in MySQL. I used version 5, but 4 should work without much modification.</li>

<li>Unpack the source files into a directory on a PHP capable webserver. PHP needs to be
	version 5.</li>
	
<li>Open <a href="../config.ini">config.ini</a> and change the MySQL settings to match your configuration.</li>

<li>Hopefully the site should now work. If it doesn't, try commenting in the line
	"AddType x-mapp-php5 .php" in <a href="../.htaccess">.htaccess</a> by putting a pound sign (#) in front of it.</li>
