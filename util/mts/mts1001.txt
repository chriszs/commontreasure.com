EXPLANATORY NOTES
     
1. Flow of Data into Monthly Treasury Statement
The Monthly Treasury Statement (MTS) is assembled from data
in the central accounting system.  The major sources of data
include monthly accounting reports by Federal entities and
disbursing officers, and daily reports from the Federal Reserve
banks.  These reports detail accounting transactions affecting
receipts and outlays of the Federal Government and off-budget
Federal entities, and their related effect on the assets and
liabilities of the U.S. Government.  Information is presented in
the MTS on a modified cash basis.
     
2. Notes on Receipts
     Receipts included in the report are classified into the
following major categories: (1) budget receipts and (2)
offsetting collections (also called applicable receipts).  Budget
receipts are collections from the public that result from the
exercise of the Government's sovereign or governmental powers,
excluding receipts offset against outlays.  These collections,
also called governmental receipts, consist mainly of tax receipts
(including social insurance taxes), receipts from court fines,
certain licenses, and deposits of earnings by the Federal Reserve
System.  Refunds of receipts are treated as deductions from  
gross receipts.
     Offsetting collections are from other Government accounts or
the public that are of a business-type or market-oriented nature. 
They are classified into two major categories: (1) offsetting
collections credited to appropriations or fund accounts, and (2)
offsetting receipts (i.e.,amounts deposited in receipt accounts). 
Collections credited to appropriation or fund accounts normally
can be used without appropriation action by Congress.  These
occur in two instances :(1) when authorized by law, amounts
collected for materials or services are treated as reimbursements
to appropriations and (2) in the three types of revolving   
funds (public enterprise, intra governmental, and trust);
collections are netted against spending, and outlays are reported
as the net amount.
     Offsetting receipts in receipt accounts cannot be used
without being appropriated.  They are subdivided into two
categories: (1) proprietary receipts - these collections are from
the public and they are offset against outlays by agency and by
function, and (2) intra governmental funds - these are payments
into receipt accounts from Governmental appropriation or fund
accounts. The transactions may be intrabudgetary when the payment
and receipt both occur within the budget or from receipts from
off-budget Federal entities in those cases where payment is made
by a Federal entity whose budget authority and outlays are
excluded from the budget totals.
     Intrabudgetary transactions are subdivided into three
categories: (1) interfund transactions, where the payments are
from one fund group (either Federal funds or trust funds) to a
receipt account in the other fund group; (2) Federal intrafund
transactions, where the payments and receipts both occur within
the Federal fund group; and (3) trust intrafund transactions,
where the payments and receipts both occur within the trust
fund group.
     Offsetting receipts are generally deducted from budget
authority and outlays by function, by subfunction, or by agency. 
There are four types of receipts, however, that are deducted from
budget totals as undistributed offsetting receipts.  They are:
(1) agencies' payments (including payments by off-budget Federal
entities) as employers into employees retirement funds,
(2)interest received by trust funds, (3) rents and royalties on
the Outer Continental Shelf lands, and(4) other interest (i.e.,
interest collected on Outer Continental Shelf money in deposit
funds when such money is transferred into the budget).  

3. Notes on Outlays
     Outlays are generally accounted for on the basis of checks
issued, electronic funds transferred, or cash payments made. 
Certain outlays do not require issuance of cash or checks. An
example is charges made against appropriations for that part of
employees' salaries withheld for taxes or savings bond allotments
- these are counted as payments to the employee and credits for
whatever purpose the money was withheld.  Outlays are stated net
of offsetting collections (including receipts of revolving and
management funds) and of refunds.  Interest on the public debt
(public issues) is recognized on the accrual basis.  Federal
credit programs subject to the Federal Credit Reform Act of
1990 use the cash basis of accounting and are divided into two
components.  The portion of the credit activities that involve a
cost to the Government (mainly subsidies) is included within the
budget program accounts.  The remaining portion of the credit
activities are in non-budget financing accounts.  Outlays of
off-budget Federal entities are excluded by law from budget
totals.  However, they are shown separately and combined with the
on-budget outlays to display total Federal outlays.
     
4. Processing
     The data on payments and collections are reported by account
symbol into the central accounting system.  In turn, the data are
extracted from this system for use in the preparation of the MTS.
     There are two major checks which are conducted to assure
consistency of the data reported:
1. Verification of payment data.  The monthly payment activity
reported by Federal entities on the Statements of Transactions is
compared to the payment activity of Federal entities as reported
by disbursing officers.
2. Verification of collection data.  Reported collections
appearing on Statements of Transactions are compared to deposits
as reported by Federal Reserve Banks.
