INTRODUCTION
     
The Monthly Treasury Statement of Receipts and Outlays of the
United States Government(MTS) is prepared by the Financial
Management Service, Department of the Treasury, and after
approval by the Fiscal Assistant Secretary of the Treasury, is
normally released on the 15th workday of the month following the
reporting month. The publication is based on data provided by
Federal entities, disbursing officers, and Federal Reserve banks.
     
AUDIENCE
     
The MTS is published to meet the needs of: Those responsible for
or interested in the cash position of the Treasury; Those who are
responsible or interested in the Government's budget results; and
individuals and businesses whose operations depend upon or are
related to the Government's financial operations.
     
DISCLOSURE STATEMENT
     
This statement summarizes the financial activities of the Federal
Government and off-budget Federal entities conducted in
accordance with the Budget of the U.S. Government, i.e. receipts
and outlays of funds, the surplus or deficit, and the means of
financing the deficit or disposing of the surplus.  Information
is presented on a modified cash basis; receipts are accounted for
on the basis of collections; refunds of receipts are treated as

reported by Federal entities, disbursing officers, and Federal
Reserve banks.
     
TRIAD OF PUBLICATIONS
     
The MTS is part of a triad of Treasury financial reports.  The
Daily Treasury Statement is published each working day of the
Federal Government.  It provides data on the cash and debt
operations of the Treasury based upon reporting of the Treasury
account balances by Federal Reserve banks.  The MTS is a report
of Government receipts and outlays, based on agency reporting. 
The U.S. Government Annual Report is the official publication of
the detailed receipts and outlays of the Government.  It is
published annually in accordance with legislative mandates given
to the Secretary of the Treasury.
     
DATA SOURCES AND INFORMATION
     
The Explanatory Notes section of this publication provides
information concerning the flow of data into the MTS and sources
of information relevant to the MTS.    

FOOTNOTES
     
TABLE 1

The receipt, outlay and deficit figures differ from the FY 2001 Budget, released by the Office of Management and Budget on February 7, 2000 by -$54 million due mainly to revisions in the data
following the release of the Final Monthly Treasury Statement. 

Note: Details may not add to totals due to rounding.

TABLE 2

These figures are based on the Mid-Session Review of the FY 2001 Budget, released the Office of Management and Budget on June 26, 2000.  The estimates would be modified by the Administration's
proposal to place the Medicare Hospital Insurance Trust Fund off-budget. This would shift that fund's totals of $110.6 billion in outlays, $134.4 billion in receipts, and a surplus of $23.8
billion, estimated for FY 2001 from on-budget to off-budget. 

Note: Details may not add to totals due to rounding.

TABLE 8
    
Note: Interfund receipts and outlays are transactions between
Federal funds and trust funds such as Federal payments and
contributions, and interest and profits on investments in Federal
securities.  They have no effect on overall budget receipts and
outlays since the receipts side of such transactions is offset
against outlays.  In this table, Interfund receipts are shown
as an adjustment to arrive at total receipts and outlays of trust
funds respectively.

EXPLANATORY NOTES
     
1. Flow of Data into Monthly Treasury Statement
The Monthly Treasury Statement (MTS) is assembled from data
in the central accounting system.  The major sources of data
include monthly accounting reports by Federal entities and
disbursing officers, and daily reports from the Federal Reserve
banks.  These reports detail accounting transactions affecting
receipts and outlays of the Federal Government and off-budget
Federal entities, and their related effect on the assets and
liabilities of the U.S. Government.  Information is presented in
the MTS on a modified cash basis.
     
2. Notes on Receipts
     Receipts included in the report are classified into the
following major categories: (1) budget receipts and (2)
offsetting collections (also called applicable receipts).  Budget
receipts are collections from the public that result from the
exercise of the Government's sovereign or governmental powers,
excluding receipts offset against outlays.  These collections,
also called governmental receipts, consist mainly of tax receipts
(including social insurance taxes), receipts from court fines,
certain licenses, and deposits of earnings by the Federal Reserve
System.  Refunds of receipts are treated as deductions from  
gross receipts.
     Offsetting collections are from other Government accounts or
the public that are of a business-type or market-oriented nature. 
They are classified into two major categories: (1) offsetting
collections credited to appropriations or fund accounts, and (2)
offsetting receipts (i.e.,amounts deposited in receipt accounts). 
Collections credited to appropriation or fund accounts normally
can be used without appropriation action by Congress.  These
occur in two instances :(1) when authorized by law, amounts
collected for materials or services are treated as reimbursements
to appropriations and (2) in the three types of revolving   
funds (public enterprise, intragovernmental, and trust);
collections are netted against spending, and outlays are reported
as the net amount.
     Offsetting receipts in receipt accounts cannot be used
without being appropriated.  They are subdivided into two
categories: (1) proprietary receipts - these collections are from
the public and they are offset against outlays by agency and by
function, and (2) intragovernmental funds - these are payments
into receipt accounts from Governmental appropriation or fund
accounts. The transactions may be intrabudgetary when the payment
and receipt both occur within the budget or from receipts from
off-budget Federal entities in those cases where payment is made
by a Federal entity whose budget authority and outlays are
excluded from the budget totals.
     Intrabudgetary transactions are subdivided into three
categories: (1) interfund transactions, where the payments are
from one fund group (either Federal funds or trust funds) to a
receipt account in the other fund group; (2) Federal intrafund
transactions, where the payments and receipts both occur within
the Federal fund group; and (3) trust intrafund transactions,
where the payments and receipts both occur within the trust
fund group.
     Offsetting receipts are generally deducted from budget
authority and outlays by function, by subfunction, or by agency. 
There are four types of receipts, however, that are deducted from
budget totals as undistributed offsetting receipts.  They are:
(1) agencies' payments (including payments by off-budget Federal
entities) as employers into employees retirement funds,
(2)interest received by trust funds, (3) rents and royalties on
the Outer Continental Shelf lands, and(4) other interest (i.e.,
interest collected on Outer Continental Shelf money in deposit
funds when such money is transferred into the budget).  

3. Notes on Outlays
     Outlays are generally accounted for on the basis of checks
issued, electronic funds transferred, or cash payments made. 
Certain outlays do not require issuance of cash or checks. An
example is charges made against appropriations for that part of
employees' salaries withheld for taxes or savings bond allotments
- these are counted as payments to the employee and credits for
whatever purpose the money was withheld.  Outlays are stated net
of offsetting collections (including receipts of revolving and
management funds) and of refunds.  Interest on the public debt
(public issues) is recognized on the accrual basis.  Federal
credit programs subject to the Federal Credit Reform Act of
1990 use the cash basis of accounting and are divided into two
components.  The portion of the credit activities that involve a
cost to the Government (mainly subsidies) is included within the
budget program accounts.  The remaining portion of the credit
activities are in non-budget financing accounts.  Outlays of
off-budget Federal entities are excluded by law from budget
totals.  However, they are shown separately and combined with the
on-budget outlays to display total Federal outlays.
     
4. Processing
     The data on payments and collections are reported by account
symbol into the central accounting system.  In turn, the data are
extracted from this system for use in the preparation of the MTS.
     There are two major checks which are conducted to assure
consistency of the data reported:
1. Verification of payment data.  The monthly payment activity
reported by Federal entities on the Statements of Transactions is
compared to the payment activity of Federal entities as reported
by disbursing officers.
2. Verification of collection data.  Reported collections
appearing on Statements of Transactions are compared to deposits
as reported by Federal Reserve Banks.
